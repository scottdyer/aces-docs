# ACES Project Governance

The ACES project aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the
benefit of the community. Participation in this project is open to all. 

As a project of the Academy Software Foundation, ACES relies on the ASWF
governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation.

## Project roles

There are three primary project roles: 
- [Contributor](#Contributor)
- [Committer](#Committer)
- [Technical Steering Committee](#Technical-Steering-Committee)

## Contributor

The contributor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the
project and wishing to contribute code, bug fixes, documentation, or other
technical artifacts to the project. 

## Committer

A Committer is a Contributor who has earned the ability to commit code directly
to the respository and approves submissions by contributors.

To become a committer, a contributor must demonstrate an understanding of the
codebase through contributions and engagement on the community channels.

Typical activities of a committer include:

- Participating in working groups
